Found this old code and decided to archive it on github.


This is a little application from 2009 for the Nokia's Maemo 5 Mobile OS (http://maemo.org).


It let you protect with a password, some Maemo stock applications (like file manager, terminal, media player, photo library). 


I made this program for my own needs, protect my privacy and fiddle with that new promising platform.
